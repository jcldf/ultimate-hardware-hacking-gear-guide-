# The Ultimate Hardware Hacking Gear Guide

## Thank you for downloading the e-zine. I am collecting feedback, fixing the links, improving the translation, and giving due credit to the projects whose true owners I didn't know (I apologize for this). Gradually, I am improving the magazine, and I greatly appreciate your feedback! It is a bit challenging to release content in English since I live in Brazil and it is not my primary language, but with the help of researchers and the community, I am working to improve the magazine!
